# Here be Dragons!

Welcome traveler, I am Patrick and you found the mystical place of *Hephaestus-Experimental*. I welcome you to explore the hidden treasures and artifacts.

Employ as much as you want... but do so on your own peril, as their APIs are changing rapidly and testing is minimal.

Among these ancient tombs, you find a proof of concept for an Argument Parser which resides in `src/parsing/console`.

Worship of these artifacts with care, as for one day their full potential may be achieved in order to elevate them to a higher place of existence.
